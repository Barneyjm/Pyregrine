<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
Apache™ Falcon is a framework for simplifying data management and pipeline processing in Apache Hadoop®. It enables users to automate the movement and processing of datasets for ingest, pipelines, disaster recovery and data retention use cases. Instead of hard-coding complex dataset and pipeline processing logic, users can now rely on Apache Falcon for these functions, maximizing reuse and consistency across Hadoop applications.
